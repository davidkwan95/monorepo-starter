# monorepo-starter
Monorepo starter is a starter kit with multi-platform development in mind. It uses yarn workspace to achieve the code sharing.

# Platform (currently) supported
- Web with server-side rendering (SSR) using Razzle
- Mobile using Expo

# Installation
Run `yarn install` in the project root

# Running
Run `yarn start` in the platform you want to run. `packages/web` for web, and `packages/mobile` for mobile.

# How it works
TBD... although I'm not sure when
